# javaee-mongo-morphia

There are already many articles and tutorials about the MongoDB-Java-Driver, but in this article, I want to step a bit
 further and show, how to basically design and implement a JavaEE Web-Application with MongoDB.
For the persistence layer, we will use Morphia as an entity-mapper, which as very closely designed to the JPA-standard
 (you will be familiar with several annotation names).
